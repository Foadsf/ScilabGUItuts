# Introduction:

<p align="justify">SciLab / ScicosLab is a great platform for those who want to enjoy a MATLAB like environment and yet respect their freedom by using Free, Libre, Open Source Software (FOSS / FLOSS). It has a great syntax similar to MATLAB with lots of libraries / addons / plugins / ATOMS. It has the amazing xcos / scicos environment for visual signal flow programing, which not only is very similar to SIMULINK, but also can integrate Modelica Language blocks, as well as C, Fortran and SciLab functions. But the software in general could be improved inn terms of documentation. One major part of the software which has been greatly underappreciated is the ability to create interactive / responsive graphic user interfaces (GUIs). To have a glimpse of what is possible you may take a look at the built-in demos which ship with the software already. Just run the command:</p>

&nbsp;

```scilab
demo_gui()
```

&nbsp;

on the console and select one of the GUI examples:

<p align="justify">The goal of this repository is to collect and elaborate on the examples which are already available on the internet and make sure they work with the latest versions of the software on different OSes. And also to go through the scripts line by line and make sure the reader understands what it does. You are expected to know the basics of SciLab language and programing in general. You should have some understanding of Object Oriented Programing (OOP) including the terms class, object, function / procedure, routine / method, property / attribute.
